# 🎮 Dodge&Shot

**Dodge&Shot** is a fast-paced 2D dodge-and-shoot game made with **Python and Pygame**.  
You control a small green circle, dodge enemies, and fight a giant boss while using your abilities wisely!



## 🕹️ Gameplay

- Move your mouse and **right-click** to move toward a point.
- **Q** – Shoot a bullet in the direction of your mouse.
- **D** – Teleport instantly to your cursor position (cooldown).
- **S** – Use slow-motion (or teleport in boss fight mode).

Survive waves of enemies, collect score, and prepare for the **boss fight at 50 points**!



## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** and **Pygame** installed:

```bash
pip install pygame

## 🧩 About the Project

This project was originally created in 2022 as a personal experiment in game design and Pygame programming.
In 2025, several code improvements and structural fixes were applied — mainly for cleaner organization,
collision logic, and gameplay smoothness — but the core mechanics and style remain true to the original version.
